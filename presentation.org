* Notes
johns starts /Nature of the Book/ in an interesting way
he articulates all the affordances of the codex
can lend, cannot declaim in public, cannot reprint, etc.
when i read this first, there was an essential irony—was reading on the computer
so if digital books are not "there" (Piper), where do you find them?
books undergird the internet, they provide a stratum of authority
the book is often embedded within an application
these books do not have their own discrete affordances, their affordances are provided by the platform that frames them
look at these examples: Google Books, Kindle

iPad applications
crowdsourced books
nonlinear reading
twine
git book > ebook as code

lori emerson, avoid magic
plain text is "there" in a way that more complex forms are not
we should cultivate a discomfort with complexity

books do stuff
digitzation threateden a book's ability to do stuff
these new applications have restored that ability
books are still books




* notes
the ebook is not an object, it is an act

or, perhaps, it is an object...in the technical sense, that of combining state and action

Nature of the Book (Johns) opens:

Pick up a modern book. This one will do: the one you are looking at right now. What sort of object is this?


Book Was There opens with discussion of St. Augustine's conversion, his use of codex (random selection, holding finger to mark place)
- the graspability of the book, in a material as well as spiritual sense

on the internet, the book is not at hand. the book undergirds
- books are like load-bearing struts, they hold up the edifice of the internet

digital books are not graspable

the open hand is the icon of the book
- book of hours (graspable)
- manicule

Book Was There: "Books are things that hold things...encapsulation"


A printed manicule directs the reader's attention in the margins of Terentius cum tribus commentis, 1501.
* oroginal proposal
Code and the Codex: E-books as Applications

What, precisely, is a book? For long periods of history, books have been associated with discrete forms, such as the scroll and the codex. Over the past two decades, the popular conception of the book has been expanded to include a succession of specialized file formats, including .lit, .mobi, and .epub. While these "standard" e-book formats allowed for new affordances and reading modalities, e-books of this kind were still fundamentally recognizable as books. More recently, however, a variety of authorship and publishing approaches have emerged that blur the boundaries among applications, platforms, and books. These developments suggest a future in which books—and the experience of reading—will be more varied and less recognizable, and suggest new modes of interaction among readers, authors, and publishers.

For the Special Session on the E-book Revolution, I propose to look beyond standard and "enhanced" e-book formats to a new and expanding category of e-book-application hybrids. These include interactive applications such as The Silent History and Device6, crowdsourced book projects, and authoring platforms that allow for nonlinear reading experiences, such as Inform and Twine. I will also touch on the use of ebook-app hybrids in scholarly publishing, such as Scalar, the nonlinear authoring platform,  and GitBooks, a version control powered writing collaboration tool. Finally, in exploring these emerging approaches to the book as a form, I will also draw on paratextual theory and the writings of Gérard Genette to sound out contemporary differences in the reception and consumption of books, using e-book/app hybrids as a point of reference to indicate how social conceptions of the book have both changed and remained the same.
